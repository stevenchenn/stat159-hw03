This subdirectory contains all the code used in this homework assignment.

The list of files includes:
+ `eda-script.R` reads in the `Advertising.csv` data set, and computes summary statistics and histograms of `TV` and `Sales`. The summary statistics should be clearly labeled, and will be saved in a file `eda-output.txt`. The charts are saved in both PNG and PDF formats.
+ `regression-script.R` reads in the `Advertising.csv` data set, and computes a `"regression"` object---via `lm()`---as well as the summary of such regression object---via `summary()`. This script also produces the scatterplot with the regression line. The R objects from the regression analysis are saved in the file `regression.RData`. In turn, the scatterplot is saved in both PNG and PDF formats.
